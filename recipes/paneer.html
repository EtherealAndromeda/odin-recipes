    <h1>Chenna</h1>
    <p>Before we make Paneer, we first have to make Chenna.</p>
    <p>This recipe will make about 9oz of chenna.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>1 Half-Gallon of Whole Milk</li>
        <li>2-4 TBSP of lemon juice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Pour the milk into a large pot. Cook on high heat, stirring frequently.</li>

        <li>When the milk begins to boil, turn off heat and add lemon juice. If seperation
            does not occurr within 10-20 seconds, add additional lemon juice as needed.</li>

        <li>Once the chenna starts to seperate from the whey, turn head to low and stir gently 
            until the whey is translucent and yellowish.</li>
        
        <li>Strain the Chenna through either a cheesecloth or a fine mesh strainer. Set aside until cool.</li>

    </ol>

    <h1>Paneer</h1>
    <p>Now that we have Chenna, we can make Paneer.</p>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <p>No additional ingredients are needed, simply take the chenna and form it into a flat 
        square. Place a moderate weight ontop of it (filling the previously used pot with
        water and setting it on top is a good methood.) for 30-60 minutes. A longer press
        time will make the paneer more firm.
