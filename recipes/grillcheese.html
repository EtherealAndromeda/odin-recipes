    <img src="../images/Grilled-Cheese.jpg" alt="grilled cheese sandwhich cut in half" height="400" width="400">
    <p>Unlike the image, this recipe actually does not use orange cheese!</p>

    

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices of whole wheat bread</li>
        <li>As many slices of pepper jack cheese as you see fit</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>2 Tsp Honey</li>
        <li>4 Tsp Cayenne Pepper</li>
        <li>Unsalted Butter</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the cheese slices between the two slices of bread</li>
        <li>Melt butter in the skillet and place sandwhich in skillet. Toast for 45 seconds, add half the Honey and Cayenne, then turn over.</li>
        <li>Season sandwhich with salt and pepper, cook for 45 more seconds before adding the remaining Honey and Cayenne, then turning it over again.</li>
        <li>Continue to cook on each side in 45-60 second increments until the bread and cheese are cooked to your liking.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Unconventional style, but I swear it's so good.</p>
